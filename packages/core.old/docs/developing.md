## Contribute to code
> If you're interested in contribuing to the code, be sure to read the code contribution guidelines first.


This article explains the process and guidelines for contributing code to the HTMLPLUS project.

### Knowledge requirements
TODO: Before taking any action, we suggest that you have relative knowledge of the following.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [StencilJs](https://stenciljs.com)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com)
- [GitHub](https://github.com)

### Setup system
This section is only for those who are using a project in GitHub for the first time, and if you have already used GitHub and JavaScript in your computer , you don't need to read this section.

#### Install NodeJs
Node JS is a server-side platform based on the Browser JavaScript engine and provides us with everything we need to run a program in JS using the JavaScript programming language instead of running in the browser. The server environment is running.
You can go [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the LTS according to your OS and install it.

#### Install Git
To receive(pull) and send(push) your codes in GitHub, you need to [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) on the system.

#### Install Editor
You can use the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) open source editor or any of your favorite editor or IDE to develop the project

### Installation
