# What's {Constants.PLATFORM_NAME}?

{Constants.PLATFORM_NAME} is a web component library. The main goal of {Constants.PLATFORM_NAME} is to produce reusable and cutting-edge web components that are compatible with all frameworks and modern browsers. To do so we used [Standard Web Platform's APIs]({Constants.WEBCOMPONENT_REFERENCE}).
Furthermore, some frameworks don’t support web components properly. You can find more about them [here]({Constants.WEBCOMPONENT_COMPATIBILITY}). But don’t worry, we prepared special packages to solve this problem. These packages work as a native library.
Frameworks and libraries are improving and new frameworks might be appearing in near future. Our responsibility is to maintain our components and keep them live, up-to-date with all changes, and compatible with new frameworks. At this time, we support the below libraries and frameworks. We keep our effort to fully support them as {Constants.PLATFORM_NAME} grows.
