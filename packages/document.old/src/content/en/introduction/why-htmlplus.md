# Why HTMLPLUS?

`HTMLPLUS` is framework-less and lightweight. It’s totally native and developed purely with javascript. All `HTMLPLUS` components are customizable and configurable. You can change their style and create your own theme. They have a standard interface of properties that let you simply configure them based on the requirements you need.
You don’t need to waste your time making and customizing components. You access lots of flexible components that can adapt with all well-known javascript frameworks. You can forget any toolkit you used to use before and start to use HTML plus instead.
