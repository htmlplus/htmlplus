# Bidirectionality

`HTMLPLUS` supports bidirectionality and it can set RTL (Right to left) and LTR (Left to Right). In `HTMLPLUS`, it is possible to set it globally and specifically for each component.

RTL format is used for languages such as Arabic and Persian. For more information click [here](https://material.io/design/usability/bidirectionality.html).

RTL and LTR specify the content display direction:

- RTL displays the content from right to left
- LTR displays the content from left to right.

Changing LTR to RTL is called Mirroring and Also, this change affects the direction of the Text, Navigation Buttons, Arrows, Switch and etc.
