# What's {CONSTANTS.PLATFORM_NAME}?

`{CONSTANTS.PLATFORM_NAME}` is a web component library. The main goal of `{CONSTANTS.PLATFORM_NAME}` is to produce reusable and cutting-edge web components that are compatible with all frameworks and modern browsers. To do so we used [Standard Web Platform's APIs]({CONSTANTS.WEBCOMPONENT_REFERENCE}).
Furthermore, some frameworks don’t support web components properly. You can find more about them [here]({CONSTANTS.WEBCOMPONENT_COMPATIBILITY}). But don’t worry, we prepared special packages to solve this problem. These packages work as a native library.
Frameworks and libraries are improving and new frameworks might be appearing in near future. Our responsibility is to maintain our components and keep them live, up-to-date with all changes, and compatible with new frameworks. At this time, we support the below libraries and frameworks. We keep our effort to fully support them as `{CONSTANTS.PLATFORM_NAME}` grows.
